# tron-lightcycle-duel
This is a 2 player game heavily inspired by the cult classic Tron franchise, and other online flash Tron games I've played with my little brother growing up. Gameplay is very similar to Snake, where the goal is to outlast the opponent in a fixed arena. This game was created in Scratch, a programming language developed by MIT.<br/>

The game can be played here at: [https://rawcdn.githack.com/lpviray/tron-lightcycle-duel/04ca862506e92532d49d9cf905e79d85c385d6ee/Tron-Lightcycle-Duel.html](https://rawcdn.githack.com/lpviray/tron-lightcycle-duel/04ca862506e92532d49d9cf905e79d85c385d6ee/Tron-Lightcycle-Duel.html)

The official project page the game was developed in can be viewed here at: [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/970518709/](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/970518709/)

Touching the opponent's light trail, your own light trail, or the edge of the arena results in your defeat. However, directly crashing into your opponent or if you both happen to hit the edge at the same time results in a draw. By default, both lightcycles will continue heading in the direction it's facing endlessly.<br/>

Player 1 controls their lightcycle using the WASD keys, with W = turn upwards, A = turn left, S = turn downwards, and D = turn right.<br/>

Player 2 controls their lightcycle using the arrow keys, with up arrow= turn upwards, left arrow = turn left, down arrow = turn downwards, and right arrow = turn right.<br/>
